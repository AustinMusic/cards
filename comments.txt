This property consists of Bldg. B of the Parkway Woods Business Park located along the east side of SW Parkway Avenue (along the east side of I-5), a few blocks south of the North Wilsonville interchange with Interstate 5, in the northeast industrial sector of the City of Wilsonville.  This building was formerly known as Bldg. 83 as part of the former Tektronix (Xerox) Campus.  The 202,743 SF GBA facility was constructed in 1981, and is demised as follows:  Class A office - 45,187 SF (22.3% GLA),  Full HVAC controlled manufacturing space - 111,556 SF (20' clear height), and Hi-bay warehouse - 46,000 SF (50' clear height). The 26.27-acre site included approximately 6.5 acres of unbuildable land under a BPA power line easement along the north boundary, which was given no value in the purchase.  The building was roughly 49.5% leased to ESS Inc. (terms unknown), with the remainder to be partially owner-occupied by a manufacturing company owned by local businessman - Charles Eggert (former owner of Pacific Foods, sold to Campbell  Soups).  The property was exposed to the market without a list price, and sold from the owner / local investment group - ScanlanKemperBard.  



This is the sale of the former Boyd's Coffee industrial facility located along the south side of NE Sandy Boulevard, just west of NE 201st Avenue, in the Airport Way / East Columbia Corridor industrial district of the City of Gresham (Portland mailing address). This 27.67-acre site also backs up to Interstate 84 along its southern boundary.  However, the rear 12.09 acres of undeveloped land has slope / topography issues which make its development costs and was given no additional value in this sale.  This is an average to good quality,-single-tenant industrial building of CTU construction with significant interior & attached office build-out. The improvements are in average, well-maintained condition.  GBA / GLA = 279,963 SF, with a total of 54,800 SF; 19.6% build-out, built in 1971 / 1989 / 2002.  Clear heights of 22 and 30 feet.  Primary site coverage = 41.2%.  In August 2017, Boyd's sold their business for $58.6 million to Texas-based Farmer Brothers.  The operation has since been shifted to Texas.  The property was marketed and sold for $18,800,000 to Dermody Properties, a Reno, NV-based investment group for renovation / conversion to two-tenant manufacturing and distribution warehouse use.  After the sale, the property was short-term leased back from Boyd's Coffee through December 31, 2018, after which the tenant will vacate.   Note that the buyer has identified several items of deferred maintenance, including roof / skylight repairs ($838,080), warehouse lights energy efficiency upgrades ($121,747), and HVAC replacements ($23,500 + $29,000).  The total hard cost associated with the owner’s identified items of deferred maintenance equates to $986,227 ($3.59 per SF). Hence, the total price adjusted for deferred maintenance is $19,786,227 ($70.67 / SF GBA). In addition, adding projected lease-up costs (leasing commissions, rent & expense loss, and TI’s, plus profit) of $3,680,000, results in a final stabilized price of $23,466,227 ($83.82 per SF GBA).

Sale of a distribution warehouse located along the south side of N. Marine Drive, mid-block just east  N. Leadbetter Road, in the Rivergate area of North Portland. The property was long-term owner-occupied as a single-tenant facility by Morgan CFS (container freight), and was marketed for sale for an extended period at $10,600,000. This price was above market for most of the 18-month marketing period, though the market finally almost caught up in terms of pricing.  The 92,160 SF CTU building includes unfenced / paved yard storage, plus possible room for minor expansion off the east side of the building (no surplus land noted though based on the SCR of 32.5%). The building includes 48 feet column spacing, exposed vinyl covered roof insulation, 1,600-amp 3-phase electrical, LED lighting in the warehouse and yard, and is fully fire sprinklered. In addition ample dock / grade level loading doors, there are also (4) exterior loading dock spots, plus (4) rail spur loading doors. The property sold to a CA-based frozen food products distributor who will build-out their own freezer / cooler & office space, and take occupancy of half the building. The price was $10,150,000 ($110.13 per SF GBA). No deferred maintenance was noted. The broker indicates that other half (GLA = 46,080 SF / office = 4,515 SF); was leased back by the seller for a 5-year term which began March 1, 2018 as follows:  shell - $0.45 / SF, office - $0.80 / SF, with 3% annual rent escalations.

Average quality distribution warehouse park located at the NWC of SW Ridder Road and SW 95th Avenue, in the industrial northwest sector of the City of Wilsonville.  Known as Stafford Distribution Center, this 4-building park consists of Bldg. A - 65,789 SF (24' clear), Bldg. B - 51,531 SF (24' clear), Bldg. C - 88,832 SF (24' clear), and Bldg. D - 48,357 SF (18' to 24' clear), and was developed in 1989 by Specht Development. The total GBA / GLA = 249,519 SF.  These are all CTU buildings with ample dock high and grade level loading doors.  The property was not exposed to the market, with the price negotiated between these two local investment groups.  Discussions with the broker for the seller - Buzz Ellis of JLL, indicate the property had a low level of office build-out (roughly 4.0% in aggregate), and sold fully occupied at a 4.95% cap rate.  This would infer NOI of $0.465 / SF, and the seller's broker indicated there was upside potential in rents due to a positive leasehold interest (amount of LH value unknown). Major tenants include Graebel Moving & Storage, Wilber Ellis Co., Rockwell Collins, etc.

Sale of a distribution warehouse located along the south side of N. Marine Drive, mid-block just east  N. Leadbetter Road, in the Rivergate area of North Portland. The property was long-term owner-occupied as a single-tenant facility by Morgan CFS (container freight), and was marketed for sale for an extended period at $10,600,000. This price was above market for most of the 18-month marketing period, though the market finally almost caught up in terms of pricing.  The 92,160 SF CTU building includes unfenced / paved yard storage, plus possible room for minor expansion off the east side of the building (no surplus land noted though based on the SCR of 32.5%). The building includes 48 feet column spacing, exposed vinyl covered roof insulation, 1,600-amp 3-phase electrical, LED lighting in the warehouse and yard, and is fully fire sprinklered. In addition ample dock / grade level loading doors, there are also (4) exterior loading dock spots, plus (4) rail spur loading doors. The property sold to a CA-based frozen food products distributor who will build-out their own freezer / cooler & office space, and take occupancy of half the building. The price was $10,150,000 ($110.13 per SF GBA). No deferred maintenance was noted. The broker indicates that other half (GLA = 46,080 SF / office = 4,515 SF); was leased back by the seller for a 5-year term which began March 1, 2018 as follows:  shell - $0.45 / SF, office - $0.80 / SF, with 3% annual rent escalations.  The seller also leased back approximately 2.0 acres of paved yard storage for $6,600 per month, or $0.076 / SF / mo. No cap rate was associated with this sale.



Average quality distribution warehouse park located at the NWC of SW Ridder Road and SW 95th Avenue, in the industrial northwest sector of the City of Wilsonville.  Known as Stafford Distribution Center, this 4-building park consists of Bldg. A - 65,789 SF (24' clear), Bldg. B - 51,531 SF (24' clear), Bldg. C - 88,832 SF (24' clear), and Bldg. D - 48,357 SF (18' to 24' clear), and was developed in 1989 by Specht Development. The total GBA / GLA = 249,519 SF.  These are all CTU buildings with ample dock high and grade level loading doors.  The property was not exposed to the market, with the price negotiated between these two local investment groups.  Discussions with the broker for the seller - Buzz Ellis of JLL, indicate the property had a low level of office build-out (roughly 4.0% in aggregate), and sold fully occupied at a 4.95% cap rate.  This would infer NOI of $0.465 / SF, and the seller's broker indicated there was upside potential in rents due to a positive leasehold interest (amount of LH value unknown). Major tenants include Graebel Moving & Storage, Wilber Ellis Co., Rockwell Collins, etc.
